# Design: Volumes & Workload-Identity Passthrough (BYO storage + identity)

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Author:** Christopher Ryan
**Topic:** Inter-step file handoff via bring-your-own shared storage, and bring-your-own
cloud identity for steps — enabling richer data-engineering pipelines and, as a bonus,
CI and infrastructure-CD use cases.

---

## 1. Summary

Give Caesium jobs two declarative capabilities, both of which **bring the resource and
Caesium only mounts/attaches it** — Caesium never provisions storage, stores bytes, or
masters a cloud role:

1. **Volumes** — a job declares named volumes backed by user-provided storage (a CSI/PVC
   in Kubernetes; an NFS/host mount or named volume in Docker/Podman). Steps mount them by
   reference; steps that co-mount a volume share its filesystem. This is the file-analog of
   the existing `##caesium::output` data contracts: a producer writes a file and emits its
   path, a downstream step reads `$CAESIUM_OUTPUT_*` and finds the file on the shared
   volume. It unblocks `extract → transform → load` handing real files along (impossible
   today under the 64 KB output cap), and equally `checkout → build → test` (CI) and
   `plan → apply` (infra-CD).

2. **Workload-identity passthrough** — a step can run under the **platform's** identity: a
   Kubernetes `serviceAccountName` wired to IRSA / EKS Pod Identity / GKE Workload Identity,
   or `AWS_ROLE_ARN` + a token file / instance profile on a Docker host. The container's
   cloud SDK then federates against the **user's** trust relationship. No OIDC issuer, no
   JWT minting, no token-signing infrastructure in Caesium.

Both ride on a **prerequisite correctness fix**: the distributed executor currently does
not apply a step's declared `env` / `workdir` / `mounts` and does not resolve `secret://`
at run time. That fix (Component 0) is the foundation that makes everything else — and the
existing `secret://` providers — actually work in distributed mode.

The guiding principle, set by the project owner: *Caesium's job is to declare, request, and
mount storage and identity — not to be storage or an identity provider.* This preserves the
zero-dependency, self-hosted, container-native identity of the project.

## 2. Motivation & current state

### 2.1 What exists

- **Container spec** (`pkg/container/spec.go`) is minimal: `Spec{ Env map[string]string;
  WorkDir string; Mounts []Mount }`, where `Mount{ Type; Source; Target; ReadOnly }` and the
  only `MountType` is `"bind"` (host path → container path). No volumes, named volumes,
  PVCs, tmpfs, resource limits, privileged flag, or service account.
- **Data contracts** ship: a step emits `##caesium::output {json}` (capped at 64 KB,
  `pkg/task/output.go`), downstream steps receive `CAESIUM_OUTPUT_<STEP>_<KEY>` env vars via
  `pkgtask.BuildOutputEnv`; `outputSchema`/`inputSchema` + `metadata.schemaValidation`
  validate the contract. This already provides dataflow-along-edges and reference-passing —
  it just cannot carry files.
- **Secret resolution** is a clean pluggable interface — `secret.Resolver.Resolve(ctx, ref)
  (string, error)` (`internal/jobdef/secret/resolver.go`), dispatched by `MultiResolver`
  (`multi.go`) across `env` / `k8s` / `vault` providers, built from env in
  `internal/jobdef/runtime/config.go:BuildSecretResolver`. Today it is invoked at git-sync,
  HTTP-trigger, and lint time — **not** in the step execution path (see 2.2).
- **Per-step engines**: `docker` / `podman` / `kubernetes`. Docker converts bind mounts in
  `internal/atom/docker/engine.go:convertMounts` (line ~267) → `mount.TypeBind`. Kubernetes
  converts every mount to a `HostPath` volume in
  `internal/atom/kubernetes/engine.go:convertKubernetesMounts` (line ~247) — **no PVC, CSI,
  named volume, or `serviceAccountName` support.**
- **Two executors**: the in-process/local executor (`internal/job/job.go`) and the
  distributed run-owner/claimer worker executor (`internal/worker/runtime_executor.go`).

### 2.2 The verified gaps this design fills

1. **The distributed executor drops the step spec (correctness bug / parity gap).**
   In `internal/worker/runtime_executor.go:executeTask()` (lines ~332–344) the container is
   created with `spec := container.Spec{}` and only `spec.Env = BuildOutputEnv(predOutputs)`.
   The step's real `atomSpec.Env` / `WorkDir` / `Mounts` are loaded **only** into the
   cache-hash input (lines ~143–167) and then discarded. By contrast the **local** executor
   (`internal/job/job.go:675–685`) merges and applies `spec.Env` + param env + output env.
   **Net effect:** step-level `env`, `secret://` references, `workdir`, and `mounts` work
   under `caesium dev` / single-node but are **silently ignored in distributed mode**. This
   blocks Volumes (which extends `Mounts`) and any credential injection in distributed mode.

2. **No inter-step file handoff.** Output is capped at 64 KB and is env-only; there is no
   shared filesystem between steps. Canonical file flows (a built binary, a `.tfplan`, a
   Parquet dataset) cannot pass between steps without the user wiring external storage by
   hand.

3. **Kubernetes engine cannot mount real storage.** Only `HostPath`. No PVC/CSI/ephemeral
   claim, so cluster-managed shared storage is unreachable.

4. **No way to attach platform cloud identity.** A k8s step always runs under the pod's
   default service account; there is no `serviceAccountName` field, so IRSA / Pod Identity /
   GKE Workload Identity cannot be targeted per step.

5. **No node-affinity primitive.** `internal/dispatch/dispatch.go` round-robins a task to
   whatever worker accepts it; there is no affinity/anti-affinity. This bounds the Volumes
   design in distributed mode (see §7).

## 3. Goals / Non-goals

**Goals**

- The distributed executor applies a step's declared `env` / `workdir` / `mounts` and
  resolves `secret://` at container-create time, **identically to the local executor**.
- A job declares named **volumes** backed by user-provided storage; steps mount them; steps
  co-mounting a volume share its filesystem.
- Kubernetes steps can mount a PVC, an ephemeral CSI claim, or a generic volume source;
  Docker/Podman steps can mount a bind path, a named volume, or tmpfs.
- A step can attach the **platform's** workload identity (k8s `serviceAccountName`;
  Docker via env/mounts), so cloud SDKs in the container federate against the user's trust.
- File handoff between steps works through the **existing** data-contract path-passing — no
  new artifact/snapshot subsystem.
- Single binary, distributed sqlite, **no new mandatory external dependency.**

**Non-goals (this spec)**

- **No OIDC issuer / JWT minting / token-signing.** Caesium never masters a cloud role.
  Workload identity is the platform's; Caesium only attaches it.
- **No object-storage handoff convention** (push/pull to S3/GCS). Strong roadmap item
  (§9), designed separately.
- **No node-affinity / co-location scheduler primitive.** Documented limitation (§7);
  roadmap item.
- **No Caesium-provisioned storage.** Backing storage is always BYO; for ephemeral volumes
  Caesium manages only the *claim object* lifecycle, never the storage itself.
- **No new container privileges** (privileged, securityContext, resource limits) — out of
  scope, tracked separately.

## 4. Architecture overview

```
Job definition (YAML)
  volumes:            ── declared once, BYO-backed
  steps[].volumeMounts ── reference a volume by name + mount path
  steps[].serviceAccountName (k8s) / env+mounts (docker) ── BYO identity

         │ apply / git-sync
         ▼
  Validation (pkg/jobdef): volumes resolvable, mounts reference declared volumes,
  one source kind per engine, a source for every engine a step uses,
  access-mode sanity, engine compatibility.

         │ stored as Atom.Spec (JSON) + Job/Trigger models
         ▼
  Execution
    Component 0 fix: BOTH executors load the full step Spec, resolve secret://
      at container-create, merge env with identical precedence.
    Engines materialize volumes + identity per runtime:
      docker/podman: bind | named volume | tmpfs ; env/mounts carry identity
      kubernetes:   PVC | ephemeral claimTemplate | generic source ; serviceAccountName
    Ephemeral-volume lifecycle: create at run start, crash-safe cleanup at run end.
```

The three components are independently testable increments and should land in order:
**0 → 1 → 2**. Component 0 is a prerequisite for 1 and 2 in distributed mode.

## 5. Component 0 — Run-time spec application + secret resolution (prerequisite)

**Problem.** The distributed worker discards the step spec (§2.2.1).

**Change.**

- Extend `NewRuntimeExecutor` (`internal/worker/runtime_executor.go:46`) to accept a
  `secret.Resolver` (built once at worker startup via
  `internal/jobdef/runtime/config.go:BuildSecretResolver`).
- In `executeTask()` (line ~312), replace `spec := container.Spec{}` (line ~332) with the
  **full** atom spec: load `atomModel.Spec` (the load already exists at lines ~145–147 for
  hashing) into `spec`, then:
  1. For every `spec.Env` value matching `secret://…`, call `resolver.Resolve(taskCtx, v)`
     and substitute the resolved value. A resolution error fails the task with a clear
     message (never silently blank).
  2. Merge predecessor-output env and `CAESIUM_PARAM_*` env on top, using the **exact
     precedence the local executor uses** (`internal/job/job.go:675–685` and 812–833).
  3. Carry `WorkDir` and `Mounts` through unchanged.
- Pass the populated `spec` to `engine.Create` (line ~341).

**Resolution timing.** Per-run, at container-create — required so short-lived /
rotation-sensitive secrets are read fresh (the `env` provider already reads
`os.LookupEnv` at resolve time; `vault`/`k8s` fetch live). Run identity is **not** needed
for the consumer providers; if a future provider needs it, the existing
`dispatchMetaFrom(ctx)` pattern (`runtime_executor.go:65`) can carry it.

**Cache-hash interaction (must preserve).** The hash already incorporates the
**unresolved** `secret://` string (via `atomSpec.Env` in `hashInput.Env`). Keep it that
way: hashing the *resolved* value would (a) leak secret material into the cache key and
(b) bust the cache on every rotation. Document: `secret://` URIs are hashed **by reference,
not value**; volatile per-run values remain excluded.

**Parity contract & test.** A golden test asserts that, for the same definition, the env /
workdir / mounts handed to `engine.Create` are byte-identical between the local executor and
the distributed executor. An integration test proves a `secret://env/...` value declared in
`step.env` reaches the container in distributed mode (this test is currently absent).

**Dependency honesty.** This makes `secret://env` work with zero external dependency;
`secret://vault` still requires a running Vault and `secret://k8s` requires cluster API
access — those are external dependencies inherent to those providers and must be labeled as
such in docs.

## 6. Component 1 — Volumes (BYO shared storage)

### 6.1 YAML surface

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: work                       # referenced by steps
    # PORTABLE form — per-engine sources so the SAME definition runs under
    # `caesium dev` (docker) and in production (kubernetes) without edits.
    # The executor selects the source matching the executing step's engine.
    sources:
      kubernetes:
        pvc: ci-shared-rwx           # pre-existing PVC (mount only)
        # claimTemplate:             #   ephemeral, CSI-provisioned (Caesium owns the claim)
        #   storageClass: nfs-csi
        #   size: 5Gi
        #   accessMode: ReadWriteMany
        # volumeSource:              #   generic k8s VolumeSource pass-through (nfs, csi, …)
        #   nfs: { server: 10.0.0.5, path: /export/caesium }
      docker:
        bind: /mnt/nfs/caesium-work  # host path — must be an NFS/shared mount on every worker
      podman:
        bind: /mnt/nfs/caesium-work
    # SHORTHAND — single-engine jobs may use one `source:` with exactly one kind:
    #   source: { pvc: ci-shared-rwx }

steps:
  - name: plan
    image: hashicorp/terraform:1.9
    command: ["sh","-c","terraform plan -out=/work/tf.plan && echo '##caesium::output {\"plan\":\"/work/tf.plan\"}'"]
    volumeMounts:
      - { volume: work, path: /work }
    outputSchema: { plan: { type: string } }

  - name: apply
    dependsOn: [plan]
    image: hashicorp/terraform:1.9
    command: ["sh","-c","terraform apply $CAESIUM_OUTPUT_PLAN_PLAN"]
    volumeMounts:
      - { volume: work, path: /work, readOnly: true }   # apply reads the exact reviewed plan
```

`volumeMounts` entry: `{ volume, path, readOnly?, subPath? }`.

### 6.2 Schema & validation (`pkg/jobdef/definition.go`)

- New `Volume` type (job-level `Definition.Volumes []Volume`) and `VolumeMount` type
  (step-level `Step.VolumeMounts []VolumeMount`).
- Update **both** `Step.UnmarshalYAML` (line ~134) and `Step.UnmarshalJSON` (line ~197) —
  the codebase has two unmarshalers that must stay in sync.
- A volume declares **either** a single `source` (one source kind) **or** a `sources` map
  keyed by engine (`kubernetes`/`docker`/`podman`), each entry holding exactly one source
  kind. The `sources` map is what makes a definition portable across `caesium dev` (docker)
  and production (kubernetes).
- Validation in `Validate()` / `validateSteps`:
  - every `volumeMounts[].volume` references a declared job volume;
  - exactly one of `source` / `sources` is set; within it, exactly one source **kind** per
    engine entry;
  - `pvc`/`claimTemplate`/`volumeSource` are k8s-only; `bind`/`volume`/`tmpfs` are
    docker/podman-only — reject a source kind that doesn't match its engine key (or, for the
    `source` shorthand, the step's `engine`);
  - every engine a step actually uses has a resolvable source for each volume it mounts —
    fail fast at lint/apply if a step runs on an engine the volume has no source for;
  - mount paths are absolute and unique per step; `accessMode` is a known value.

### 6.3 Container spec & engines

- Extend `pkg/container/spec.go`: add a resolved volume model to `Spec` (named volume refs +
  mount descriptors) alongside the existing bind `Mounts` (kept for backward compatibility).
  The whole `Spec` already serializes to `Atom.Spec` JSON and flows to distributed workers,
  so no new transport is needed.
- **Docker/Podman** (`internal/atom/docker/engine.go:convertMounts`, podman equivalent): add
  `mount.TypeVolume` (named volume) and `mount.TypeTmpfs` alongside `TypeBind`.
- **Kubernetes** (`internal/atom/kubernetes/engine.go:convertKubernetesMounts`): emit
  `PersistentVolumeClaim` volume sources, ephemeral `volumeClaimTemplate`, and generic
  pass-through `VolumeSource`s — not only `HostPath`. Reuse `sanitizeVolumeName`.

### 6.4 Ephemeral-volume lifecycle

- **External** sources (`pvc`, `bind`, named `volume`, generic source): mount only; Caesium
  never creates or deletes them.
- **Ephemeral** (k8s `claimTemplate` / a per-run named docker/podman volume): Caesium creates
  the claim object / volume at **run start** and deletes it at **run terminal state**. Backing
  storage is still BYO (the StorageClass/CSI/volume driver). Cleanup must be **crash-safe**:
  tie deletion to run completion in the run-owner state machine and add an orphan-reaper that
  GCs ephemeral volumes whose run is terminal/absent (mirrors the existing cache pruner
  pattern). Name ephemeral resources deterministically by run id for reliable GC.
- **Distributed-mode constraint on ephemeral docker/podman volumes (important):** a named
  docker/podman volume lives on a single daemon's local host. With no node-affinity (§7), a
  run-owner that creates a per-run named volume cannot share it with a co-mounting step
  dispatched to a *different* worker — that worker would silently auto-create an empty
  local volume of the same name, losing data. Therefore **ephemeral named docker/podman
  volumes are single-node-only**; validation rejects them when execution mode is distributed.
  Cross-node sharing on docker/podman requires an **external** `bind` source pointing at a
  shared network filesystem (NFS/CephFS) mounted on every worker (which Caesium mounts but
  does not manage). Ephemeral cross-node scratch on k8s works only with an **RWX**
  `claimTemplate` storage class (RWO has the same single-mounter limitation — see §7).

### 6.5 File handoff via existing contracts (no new subsystem)

No change to the contract mechanism. The producer emits the file's path as a normal output
(`##caesium::output {"plan":"/work/tf.plan"}`); the consumer reads `$CAESIUM_OUTPUT_PLAN_PLAN`
and finds the file because both steps mount `work`. Because Caesium does **not** own the
bytes, it does **not** content-address volume contents — only the path string flows into the
cache key. Document this explicitly: changing a file on a shared volume does **not**
auto-invalidate a downstream cache the way a changed string output does. Mitigations: a step
may emit a content hash of its output as a normal output (which *does* fold into the cache
key); ephemeral scratch is fresh per run regardless.

## 7. Distributed-mode behavior & the RWX-only limitation

A shared volume only works where it is reachable by the worker that runs each co-mounting
step. Because the dispatcher has **no node-affinity primitive** (§2.2.5):

- **ReadWriteMany** storage (NFS, CephFS, EFS via CSI; or a host NFS mounted on every Docker
  worker) — any node can co-mount. **Fully supported; this is the recommended mode for
  fan-out/fan-in DAGs in distributed deployments.**
- **ReadWriteOnce** PVCs / per-run scratch — only one node can mount at a time. Co-locating
  the co-mounting steps **is not expressible today**. For v1 this is a **documented
  limitation**: RWO volumes are safe only when the DAG segment sharing them is effectively
  serial on one node, which Caesium cannot currently guarantee in distributed mode.
  Single-node (Docker/Podman, or a single-worker cluster) is unaffected.
- **Docker/Podman named (and ephemeral) volumes are node-local — never shareable across
  workers.** Unlike a k8s RWX PVC, there is no cross-node docker/podman volume. In a
  multi-worker docker/podman deployment, the only way to share a volume between steps that
  may land on different workers is an **external `bind` source backed by a shared network
  filesystem** (NFS/CephFS) mounted at the same path on every worker. Named/ephemeral
  docker/podman volumes are therefore validated as **single-node-only** (§6.4).

A node-affinity primitive (to make RWO co-location safe) and an object-storage handoff path
(node-agnostic, no co-location needed) are the two roadmap items that lift this limitation
(§9). The spec does **not** attempt either here; it ships the RWX-correct behavior and names
the boundary honestly.

## 8. Component 2 — Workload-identity passthrough (BYO cloud identity)

Caesium attaches the **platform's** identity to a step; the container's cloud SDK federates
against the **user's** trust relationship. Caesium mints nothing and masters no role.

### 8.1 Kubernetes

Add `serviceAccountName` (step-level, with an optional job-level default), plus optional
pod `annotations` and `automountServiceAccountToken`, to the step schema and the k8s engine
pod spec. The user creates a ServiceAccount annotated for their mechanism — IRSA
(`eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`), EKS Pod Identity, or GKE Workload Identity — and Caesium runs
the step's pod under it. The AWS/GCP SDK in the container then resolves credentials from the
projected token automatically.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: terraform-apply
    image: hashicorp/terraform:1.9
    serviceAccountName: caesium-deployer   # user-owned SA ↔ cloud role trust
    volumeMounts: [{ volume: work, path: /work, readOnly: true }]
    command: ["terraform","apply","/work/tf.plan"]
```

### 8.2 Docker / Podman

No new field needed. Once Component 0 applies step `env`/`mounts`, the user attaches identity
the standard way: set `AWS_ROLE_ARN` + `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` (or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_
CREDENTIALS`) via `env`, mount the token file / `~/.aws` via `mounts`, or rely on the host
instance profile. Documented as a usage pattern, not a feature.

### 8.3 Why no threat model

Caesium does not issue tokens or hold a signing key, so there is no cross-job subject
spoofing, audience confusion, or key-rotation surface to model. The trust relationship lives
entirely in the user's cloud IAM and platform service accounts. The only authorization
question is *which steps may name which service account* — handled by existing
job-definition review (GitOps PR) and RBAC on apply, not by a new mechanism.

## 9. Roadmap sketch (documented, designed in later specs)

Each is dual-purpose — framed data-engineering-first, with CI/CD as the bonus:

- **Object-storage handoff convention** — node-agnostic file passing via explicit
  `aws s3 cp`/`gcloud storage cp` push/pull to a **user** bucket, with a Caesium-owned key
  convention (`<bucket>/<job_alias>/<run_id>/<step>/…`) and injected creds (Component 2).
  Caesium never touches the bytes. This is the node-agnostic alternative to RWO volumes and
  the cross-cluster handoff path. *(Reject s3fs/gcsfuse mounting — non-POSIX trap; reject a
  Caesium-run stager — puts bytes in Caesium's path.)*
- **Node-affinity / co-location primitive** — unblocks RWO volumes in distributed mode.
- **Digest-pinned cache keys** — the cache hashes the image **tag** string, not the resolved
  digest (`internal/cache/hash.go`); a mutable `:latest` can serve stale cached outputs. A
  correctness fix that benefits every workload.
- **Matrix fan-out** — backfill-style fan-out for data + test-matrix / multi-region apply.
- **Approval gates** — gate a destructive reprocess for data + a prod apply for CD.
- **Apply-only resource lock** — a dqlite-backed named mutex; serialize a warehouse load for
  data + Terraform state for CD. Zero new dependency.
- **Event-driven job chaining** — DAG-of-DAGs for data + cross-stack ordering for CD (the
  designed but unshipped event-trigger routing).
- **Forge status / PR-comment callback** — surfaces run status (and plan diffs) on PRs;
  reuses the existing callback/webhook subsystem.

## 10. Testing strategy

- **Component 0:** golden parity test (local vs distributed env/workdir/mounts identical);
  integration test that `secret://env` in `step.env` reaches a distributed container; test
  that a resolution failure fails the task with a clear error.
- **Component 1:** unit tests for schema validation (engine/source compatibility, dangling
  mount refs, dup paths); per-engine conversion tests (docker named volume + tmpfs; k8s PVC +
  ephemeral claim + generic source); an integration test where two steps share a volume and
  pass a file (the `plan → apply` example) on each engine that supports it; ephemeral
  create/cleanup test including crash/orphan-reaper.
- **Component 2:** k8s engine test asserting `serviceAccountName`/annotations land on the pod
  spec; a documented manual verification recipe for IRSA/GKE-WI (cannot be hermetic).

## 11. Risks & open items

- **RWO/distributed limitation (§7)** is a real ergonomic boundary; mitigated by clear docs
  + the RWX recommendation, lifted later by node-affinity / object-storage handoff. The
  docker/podman analogue is sharper — named/ephemeral volumes are node-local and validated
  single-node-only; distributed docker/podman sharing requires a shared-network-FS `bind`.
- **Ephemeral-volume leak risk** if cleanup is not crash-safe → the orphan reaper is
  mandatory, not optional.
- **Cache correctness for file outputs (§6.5)** — files are not content-addressed; documented,
  with the emit-a-hash escape hatch. The separate digest-pinned-cache fix (§9) is orthogonal.
- **Two unmarshalers** (`UnmarshalYAML` + `UnmarshalJSON`) must both be updated for any new
  step field — a known footgun in `definition.go`.
- **Backward compatibility:** existing bind `mounts:` keep working unchanged; `volumes:` /
  `volumeMounts:` / `serviceAccountName` are additive and optional.
